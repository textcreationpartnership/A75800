            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING in the <hi>firſt part of this work</hi> ſpoken at large, concerning the ordering of <hi>Naturall Fruit-trees,</hi> in all reſpects, and of the great <hi>Profits, Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> that ariſe thence; I ſhall now conſider <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> upon another Accompt; and endeavour to make ſome <hi>Spirituall uſe,</hi> and <hi>improvement of them.</hi> And this ſhould be our care, as to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which we have to do with, upon all occaſions: according to the example of our <hi>Lord, and Saviour,</hi> whoſe uſe it was to <hi>ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life Naturall</hi> and <hi>Morall things,</hi> when he converſed with us in his bodily preſence, as we ſee frequently in Scripture. When the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſpake of <hi>waſhing their hands before meate.</hi> Matth. 15.20. Chriſt inſtructs them (thereupon) about <hi>ſpirituall defilements;</hi> when the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> came <hi>to draw water,</hi> Chriſt tells her <hi>of living water,</hi> Joh. 4.10. When his diſciples brought him <hi>Meate,</hi> he tells them he had <hi>meate they knew not of,</hi> it was <hi>meate, and drinke to him to do his fathers will,</hi> Jo. 4.34 When the man ſpake of having his inheritance divided <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.13. our Saviour (thereupon) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs him, and others at large, to beware of <hi>coveteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>worldly cares:</hi> when the multitude followed him having eaten of the <hi>Loaves,</hi> Jo. 6. <hi>Chriſt</hi> thereupon counſells them to <hi>labour for the meat that periſheth not, for the bread of life,</hi> Joh. 6.26.</p>
            <p>And many <hi>ſpirituall things</hi> he illuſtrates by <hi>Similitudes</hi> from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things:</hi> as we ſee Matth. 13. (and many other places) from <hi>Scede, Tares, Muſtard-ſeed, Leaven, a Treaſure in the Feild, a Pearle,
<pb facs="tcp:168464:3"/> a draw net &amp;c.</hi> So ſhould we make <hi>a Spirituall uſe of Naturall things;</hi> and ſo turne Earth (as it were) into heaven.</p>
            <p>When we have gone through all the workes and labours to be performed in the <hi>Orchard,</hi> and have received thereby a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Temporall <hi>Profits and Pleaſures</hi> in the uſe of the <hi>Trees and Fruits,</hi> we may (beſides all that) make a <hi>Spirituall uſe</hi> of them, and receive more and greater <hi>Profits and Pleaſures</hi> thereby. Men are not wont to ſtint themſelves at <hi>wordly Profits,</hi> but why are they not willing to receive <hi>all kinds of Profits,</hi> or why are they not willing to receive the <hi>greateſt,</hi> and <hi>beſt?</hi> ſhould a man chuſe, and preferre a <hi>Glaſſe-beade</hi> or <hi>Toy</hi> before ſome <hi>Pretious, and Rich Jewell,</hi> would he not be cenſured for a fooliſh man: how much more fooliſh, and unwiſe is he that ſeeks after <hi>Temporall Profits,</hi> and neglects <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and <hi>Eternall?</hi> therefore be carefull to make a ſpirituall improvement of <hi>fruit-trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> is a great <hi>Library, and Fruit-trees</hi> are ſome of the <hi>Books</hi> wherein we may read and ſee plainely the <hi>Attributes of God, his Power, Wiſdome, Goodneſſe &amp;c.</hi> and be inſtructed and taught our duty towards him in many things, even from Fruit-trees: for as trees (in a Metaphoricall ſence) are <hi>Books,</hi> ſo likewiſe in the ſame ſence they have a <hi>Voyce,</hi> and ſpeak plainely to us, and teach us many good leſſons.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaies, <hi>God hath two great Books which we ought to ſtudy,</hi> his <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Works: the one diſcovers his Will, the other his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaies Rom. 1.20. <hi>The inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearely ſeene, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternall Power and Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Creatures of God</hi> are to be ſtudied as <hi>Books,</hi> for in them we may read the <hi>Attributes of God</hi> and obſerve ſome ſmall reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, and darke ſhadowes of his infinite <hi>Excellencies, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi> they are ſeene <hi>Per ſpeculum Creaturarum:</hi> They who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read a line in any Printed Book, may read many good leſſons in the Book of the Creatures.</p>
            <p>Fruit-trees though they are dumb companions, yet (in a ſence) we may diſcourſe with them:<note place="margin">The Saints ſoule exalting humiliation. p. 87. et p. 205.</note> The works of God ſpeak to the mind as his Word does to the Eare. Mr <hi>Boulton</hi> ſaies <hi>Our Eyes (Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the Sabbath day) ought as little Bees fall upon ſeverall objects,
<pb facs="tcp:168464:3"/> and from them (as from ſo many Flowers) gather hony, and bring it into the hive; That is, ſweet, heavenly, wholſome Meditations for mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the Creator in all his Attributes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> and other Creatures do truely (though without an articulate voyce) Preach the <hi>Attributes and perfections of God</hi> to us; And we may read divine Truthes in them, as in a Book conſiſting of words and ſentences; the Creatures of God (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natures) ſpeak out the praiſes of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145.10. <hi>All thy workes praiſe thee O Lord, and among them Fruitfull Trees,</hi> 148.9.</p>
            <p>Things without ſenſe or life, have a voyce, and ſpeak to us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God.</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>Their voyces are heard in every language, or Nation.</hi> and verſ. 4. <hi>Their words go to the ends of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that not only <hi>rationall and irrationall,</hi> but even <hi>Inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> have a <hi>voyce,</hi> and ſpeak loudly to men, and it is our duty to learne their language, and hearken to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All Creatures</hi> (as a holy Man ſaies) <hi>have a teaching voyce, they read us divinity Lectures of divine Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt be content to ſtoope to their way and manner of teaching, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and others in former times, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Hyeroglyphiques,</hi> by ſomething repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the eye, <hi>Notions</hi> were conveyed to the underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dumbe Creatures</hi> ſpeak <hi>virtually and convincingly to the mind, and Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we make uſe of Creatures to ſerve our turne only in reference to our outward man, we make not halfe that uſe of them as we ought, we ſhould ſtudy the Creatures and learne from them, to bring us nearer the Creator. Climbing up by them, as by <hi>ſteps,</hi> or <hi>ſtaires,</hi> till we aſcend to the higheſt Good.</p>
            <p>How much of the goodneſſe and excellencies of God do Fruit-trees ſhew forth when they (in their ſeaſons) flouriſh with <hi>Leaves Bloſſomes</hi> and <hi>Fruits;</hi> eſpecially conſidered not only as they appeare beautifull to the eye, but alſo with all their <hi>inward beauties</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>their virtues, and uſes in the life of man?</hi> Both in <hi>Alimentall and Phyſicall</hi> reſpects; but moſt of all, as they are <hi>Similitudes</hi> and beare the figure, and reſemblance of many high and great Myſteries in the Word of God: the Analogie and reſemblance is very neere
<pb facs="tcp:168464:4"/> in many things to the moſt noble viſible Creature MAN. <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> beare the Figure and reſemblance of what is of higheſt eſteeme with God, <hi>his People, his Jewells, his Adopted Sons,</hi> yea of his <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sonne,</hi> as we frequently find in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Likeneſſe and reſemblance of inferior Creatures to thoſe above them, does ennoble, and put ſome dignity upon them, according to the degree of likeneſſe. Now what Creatures beare reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to man in ſo many reſpects as <hi>Fruit-trees?</hi> ſee the <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> pag. 1. 2. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>What riſeth, or growes upon the Tree that is not brought, or drawen out of the ſeed, as out of a certaine Store-houſe, or Treaſury?</p>
            <p>Fruit-trees diſcover many things of God, and many things of our ſelves, and concerning our duty to God. We enquire of, and diſcourſe with Fruit-trees when we conſider, and meditate of them, when we ſearch out their virtues and perfections which God hath put into them, when we pry into their natures, and properties, <hi>that is ſpeaking to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we (after a ſerious ſearch) do make ſome uſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of what we ſee in them, when we collect ſomething from them
<pb facs="tcp:168464:4"/> concerning the <hi>Power, Wiſdome, Goodneſſe, and Perfections of God,</hi> or our duty to God, <hi>that is the Anſwer of the Fruit-trees;</hi> then Fruit-trees ſpeak to the mind, and tell us many things, and teach us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good leſſons.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Conſiderations</hi> of them are the <hi>Queſtions</hi> we put to them, and the <hi>Inferences</hi> or <hi>Concluſions,</hi> are their <hi>Anſwers.</hi> Thoſe are the <hi>Leſſons</hi> they teach us.</p>
            <p>Of this ſee Mr <hi>Caryl</hi> his Expoſition on <hi>Job. chap.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> tells us of many Maſters, Creatures of which we may learne, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>The Beaſts, the Fiſhes &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Speak to the Earth and it ſhall teach thee &amp;c.</hi> or (as it is interpreted) <hi>aske every ſlip or ſprig that growes in the Earth, and it ſhall teach thee. Naturall, and viſible things</hi> are ſhadowes to us of <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and the Spirit of God from things <hi>ſenſible, and viſible,</hi> raiſeth our minds to things <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ancients were skilled in this kind of Learning, in teaching by SIMILITUDES, and one of them obſerves, that God ſent us the <hi>Booke of Nature,</hi> before he ſent us the <hi>Book of the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The People of God in the beginning of the World were without the Scriptures for many yeares, and they read many things in the <hi>Book of the Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaac went to meditate in the Feilds</hi> Gen. 24.63. And no doubt learned many Leſſons from the Creatures.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Church</hi> had ſome part of the Scriptures, yet were they inſtructed for the ſpace of two thouſand yeares together by <hi>Similitudes,</hi> for what was all the <hi>old adminiſtration,</hi> but <hi>ſhadowes,</hi> or <hi>Similitudes</hi> of things to come, all ſhadowing out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>things of Chriſt?</hi> So the Apoſtle tells us Heb. 10 1. <hi>The law having the ſhadow of good things to come;</hi> and Heb. 8.5. <hi>The example and ſhadow of heavenly things:</hi> and Heb. 9.23. <hi>The Similitudes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things.</hi> All their <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were <hi>Similitudes</hi> of <hi>heavenly,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall things,</hi> whereby they were taught, and inſtructed.</p>
            <p>Teaching by SIMILITUDES is the moſt plaine way of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and makes dark things more cleare to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and beſt to be retained in the <hi>Memory.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour (the great Prophet and teacher of his Church, who ſpake as never man ſpake) he taught much by SIMILITUDES in his owne perſon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:168464:5"/> his coming in the fleſh, by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> as we ſee Hoſ: 12.10. <hi>I have uſed Similitudes by the Miniſtry of the Prophets:</hi> ſo we find in Eſay, Ezekiel, and the reſt.</p>
            <p>One ſaies, <hi>as Windowes are to a houſe, ſo are</hi> SIMILITUDES <hi>to a Diſcourſe:</hi> they both let in light to ſee and diſcerne things that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be obſcure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> are a TEXT from which may be raiſed many profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Concluſions,</hi> which may be proved by Scripture, and Experience.</p>
            <p>Now therefore; ſeeing many things may be learned from Fruit-trees for Spirituall profit; I ſhall ſet downe ſome <hi>Obſervations</hi> which I have made upon them, diſcovering the Nature, and ordering of <hi>Naturall, and Spirituall Fruit-trees,</hi> in divers SIMILITUDES, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> ſpeaking of moſt particulars <hi>very breifly.</hi>

               <hi>Hieroglyphicks;</hi> whereby you have made the creatures ſpeak plaine. Its goſpell wiſedome that muſt make your young plants to beare ſuch apples of gold. <hi>Do men gather grapes of thornes or figs of thiſtles? ſaith Chriſt.</hi> No: naturally they will not yeeld ſuch

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE bleſſed God hath a <hi>ſpeciall work</hi> to do in the world, in which he imployes his faithfull ſervants, and ſuch oftentimes as are (in compariſon of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) but as <hi>Babes in Chriſt;</hi> when ſuch as the men of the world eſteeme the only <hi>wiſe men,</hi> are rejected of the Lord. God for his owne glory is pleaſed to ſtaine the pride of men to pull down ſuch as lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and attribute that glory to themſelves which is only due to God; and exalts ſuch as are of <hi>low degree,</hi> Luk. 1.52, 53. ſuch as ſee, &amp; are hartily affected with their owne emptineſſe, and inſufficiency, and are enabled to role themſelves on God, for wiſdome, and ſtrength to do his work faithfully. God hath for the moſt part made uſe of <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to bring about his <hi>great deſignes,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> ſuch as have been ſcorned, and contemned by <hi>ungodly learned men,</hi> who reject the pretious truths of God, becauſe God ſends and imployes ſuch of his ſervants to diſpence them unto men, that have not ſuch <hi>humane learning, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> as themſelves, the only things in a carnall Eye, but poore, low things in a ſpirituall Eye, in compariſon of the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſpirit of God. I know, and do freely grant, that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning</hi> is a moſt choice and excellent gift, when it is ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any perſon, and that which God hath made uſe of in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſometimes to carry on, and promote his great workes, and intereſts in the world: And I do greatly honour ſuch <hi>gratious learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men,</hi> as improve their <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>learning for God;</hi> and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have a low eſteeme of <hi>Learning,</hi> and ſpeak ſlightly of it, or of <hi>Learned men</hi> becauſe <hi>ſuch,</hi> I dare affirme ſuch men ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of that which they underſtand not. I am no enemy to <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning,</hi> as ſome in the Univerſity have affirmed, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed others in the Country with the ſame opinion of me, my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe can witneſſe; for it is well knowne that I ſpent many yeares in the Univerſity and Country, to obtaine a little, that I might be the more ſerviceable to God in my generation; and I find that that which the Lord hath given me, is very uſefull unto me in the work that I am called unto by God, and men. But I ſhall intreate, And do earneſtly deſire <hi>ſome Learned men,</hi> both in the
<pb facs="tcp:168464:7"/> Univerſity and Country, ſeriouſly to conſider, whether or no they do not greatly, and apparently abuſe their <hi>Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In preferring it before the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and the <hi>ſaving knowledge of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In having higher thoughts of themſelves than of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who it may be, are more <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Humble,</hi> and have more of the <hi>teachings of the Spirit of God</hi> than themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In deſpiſing, and contemning their <hi>Perſons, Sermons, Bookes, Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> becauſe they have not ſo much <hi>Humane Learning</hi> as themſelves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In diſcouraging, and hindering ſuch ſervants of the Lord as deſire to improve their <hi>Graces,</hi> and <hi>gifts</hi> for God, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to commend the Lord Chriſt to others for their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, By endeavoring to prejudice the minds of men againſt <hi>ſuch,</hi> who yet God imployes in the work of the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, In boaſting of their <hi>Parts,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and reſting thereon, forgetting God who gave it.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly, In neglecting to uſe their <hi>Learning</hi> for that end for which God beſtowed it on them.</p>
            <p>Conſider: hath God given you <hi>larger opportunities,</hi> and <hi>greater helps,</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> than others, that you ſhould be <hi>more idle,</hi> and <hi>unfruitfull</hi> than others? the Lord awaken you, and make you zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and active for your Maſter in this time of need, (many places have been a long time deſtitute of godly able Preachers) that when he ſhall come he may ſay unto you, well done good and faithfull ſervants, enter into the joy of your Lord.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Author</hi> of the following <hi>Obſervations,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes,</hi> what ever <hi>Carnall men,</hi> or the <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>Spirituall men</hi> may object (as who that is zealous, and active for God, can eſcape the cenſures of ſome men) it evidently appeares to me, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath carried him on in this work. Reject not the work becauſe it is not done by a <hi>Publique Miniſter of the Goſpell,</hi> for many <hi>private experienced Chriſtians</hi> have beene (in this way) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable to the Church of God; Theſe are the <hi>laſt times,</hi> wherein God fulfills his great <hi>Goſpell promiſe, in powring out his Spirit upon all fleſh;</hi> and thoſe whom God intends for any <hi>ſpeciall ſervice,</hi> he prepares them for it by ſome <hi>ſpeciall preparations.</hi> I have ſeene a large particular <hi>Relation,</hi> compoſed by this Author
<pb facs="tcp:168464:7"/> of God's dealings with him for many yeares together; wherein it appeares, that God began betime with him, <hi>early,</hi> even the <hi>firſt houre of the day:</hi> And he hath beene exerciſed with many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations from his youth up; having paſſed through the <hi>ſpirit of bondage early in the morning,</hi> and by degrees came to cloſe with Chriſt, and to attaine a comfortable aſſurance of his intereſt in him: But afterwards, even <hi>about the middle of the day</hi> (upon the ſpirits withdrawing and God's hiding of his face for ſome gratious ends) he fell into <hi>a long, and ſad deſertion,</hi> paſſing through the valley of the ſhadow of death, the paines of hell gat hold upon him, and that in an extraordinary way and meaſure; But God (by degrees) lifted him up out of the deepe Pit, out of the Mire, and Clay, and ſet his feet upon a Rock, and hath put a new ſong into his Mouth, and made him active for God in his Generation.</p>
            <p>As for his following Labours, I doubt not but God will make them very uſefull, and profitable to the people of God: what is more helpfull to the underſtanding, and remembring of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, than plaine, and pregnant SIMILITUDES, of things which we are daily converſant with? (all theſe being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo enlarged upon by him and improved to ſpirituall ends, and advantages.) What was all the old <hi>Ceremoniall Law,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeares, but teaching the People by SIMILITUDES, <hi>Tipes,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which were all <hi>ſhadowes of things to come?</hi> Heb. 10.1. The ſpirit of God uſed SIMILITUDES by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Prophets Hoſ. 12.10. yea; the great Prophet of the Church frequently uſed SIMILITUDES in his teachings; and Miniſters of the Goſpell in our daies find them very uſefull, and profitable in their teachings.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (Reader) I recommend the following Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Similitudes to thy uſe; Praying that the ſpirit of God may engraft every truth into thy heart, and cauſe it to grow, and bring forth much good fruit, to the glory and praiſe of God, and thy owne everlaſting good.</p>

               <p>It is obſerved by <hi>Experience,</hi> That God worketh that great worke of Repentance, and Converſion of a ſinner, from darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light before old age, <hi>generally,</hi> and for the moſt part: Moſt commonly <hi>in youth,</hi> or <hi>full ſtrength.</hi>

               <p>God gives men warning before hand, and tells them he will not accept of them hereafter, though they knocke at the <hi>Gate of Mercy,</hi> it ſhall be ſhut againſt them, if they will not now accept of Mercy.

               <p>If <hi>Fruit-trees in a Nurſery</hi> (where there are ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in a little compaſſe) were permitted to grow there many yeares, they could not poſſibly ſpread, nor inlarge their Branches, whereby they might beare ſtore of Fruits, but would fret and gall, and rub off the <hi>Barke, Bloſſomes, and fruits,</hi> of one another.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This truth is clearely held forth unto us in Scripture; It is a great Myſtery, not underſtood, or comprehended by any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, and better underſtood (in our own ſpirits by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) than expreſſed to others. The Apoſtle ſaies 2 Cor. 4.16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them and walke in them.</hi> And 1 Joh. 4.16. <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> Believers dwell in God <hi>the father,</hi> and <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>in the ſpirit;</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> dwell in them.

I <hi>live yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note> by this <hi>ſpirituall or myſticall union</hi> between <hi>God and his people,</hi> they are made <hi>one with God:</hi> Not to be underſtood as ſome have ſaid, That every believer hereby is God, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance themſelves above what is meet. It is true believers are made one with Chriſt, 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> and Epheſ. 4.4. <hi>There is one body, and one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is the prayer of our Lord Chriſt (which is certainly heard) that his people, with his father, and himſelfe may be one. Joh. 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us. v.</hi> 22. <hi>And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are

               <p>What a wonderfull <hi>myſtery</hi> is this, that Believers ſhould be united to, and made <hi>one with God,</hi> as the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> are one?

               <p>As the Stock and the Graft are <hi>really joyned together,</hi> and are one within the other, and made one body, ſo are Believers really united to God, God dwelling in them, and they in God, and are made one ſpirit with him through Chriſt, 1 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit.</hi> And againe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one ſpirit we are united, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Who was a more fruitfull Chriſtian than <hi>David the holy Prophet?</hi> he was ſo eminently fruitfull, and brought forth ſo much and ſo lovely fruits, as that God himſelfe commends him, and ſaies he walked in all the commandments according to his owne heart (one particular excepted) and we ſee of what a ſpirit he was in reſpect of <hi>humility, Pſal.</hi> 131.1.2. <hi>My heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty, my ſoule is even as a weaned Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſcovers a ſpirit of more then ordinary humility, 1 Cor. 15 9. <hi>I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, that am not meete to be called an Apoſtle.</hi> And as though that were not low enough, he deſcends lower: <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints, Eph.</hi> 3.8.

               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons hereof are, firſt: <hi>humble Chriſtians</hi> have more from God then others; becauſe <hi>neerer God:</hi> they walke with God, and Communicates himſelfe to them more then to others, as familiar friends communicate ſecrets one to another: ſo God to the <hi>humble ſoule</hi> that walkes with him, <hi>He giveth grace to the humble:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>He will teach the humbe his way.

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Humble Chriſtians</hi> are moſt fruitfull, becauſe they receive profit from all perſons, from all things, they can learne ſomething from everie thing, from the meaneſt from the worſt (whereas <hi>proud perſons</hi> thinke they have ſo much that they'l learne from none) ſo that their advantages are both from <hi>heaven and earth,</hi> as <hi>materiall trees</hi> growing <hi>low, neere the ground</hi> have not only the <hi>ſun and raine,</hi> but alſo ſome advantage by the reflection of the ſunne beames from the earth: which <hi>tall, high Trees</hi> have not.</p>

                  <hi>are contrary to the Judgments of moſt people in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all ages, God and his waies have beene oppoſed, by the corrupt reaſonings of men: Man in his naturall eſtate cannot ſee God, nor the things of God, he <hi>perceiveth them not, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14.</p>
               <p>When God is about that <hi>great worke</hi> to bring ſoules out of the ſnare, and <hi>bondage of Sathan,</hi> into the <hi>glorious liberty of the ſonnes of God; his waies</hi> whereby he does this, are <hi>very ſtrange to moſt men:</hi> when they ſee poore creatures humbled, and broken in their ſpirits, and ſometimes almoſt diſtracted through feares, and apprehenſions of wrath, or under any other great Affliction, what doe moſt people thinke of ſuch? ſee, ſay they, how God plagues them for their <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> they will preſently cenſure them for diſſemblers: <hi>David</hi> being under Afflictions, became <hi>a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a monſter unto many, Pſ.</hi> 71.7. they judged God had forſaken him, verſ. 11. Even ſo it is now.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:168464:49"/>
               <p>And as it is thus in reſpect of particular perſons, ſo alſo in reſpect of the whole Church. When God went about to enlarge his Church in the daies of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.1.</note> how <hi>contrary</hi> were his <hi>waies and diſpenſations</hi> to the judgments of moſt then; In ſending forth a few poore plaine men (two, and two) to preach the Goſpell and win ſoules? how did the <hi>Learned proud Phariſees,</hi> and moſt of the people, deſpiſe them, and perſecute them from city to city? They underſtood not what God was about, no more then the people of this generation. O how contrary are the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God to the apprehenſions of moſt in this age! They ſpeake againſt his waies, contradicting, and blaſpheming.</p>
               <p>Yea the waies of God are contrary to the apprehenſions of <hi>many of the godly among us,</hi> ſome of them directly oppoſe God, and his <hi>great deſigne,</hi> others doe not, cannot put to their hand to further it, for they apprehend it not, they cannot cloſe with it: In their <hi>Sermons, Prayers, Diſcourſes,</hi> they ſpeak nothing of it, to promote it, nay (being darkned through intereſts, and corruptions) they oppoſe it, and ſpeake againſt it, and thoſe who carry it on.</p>
               <p>The reaſons hereof are cheifely theſe.</p>
               <p>As for all <hi>naturall men,</hi> they judge of things according to <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Principles, ſence, and Reaſon,</hi> now when the waies of God are not ſuted to theſe, they cannot ſee, nor judge of them: <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man cannot perceive the things of God,</hi> for they have no <hi>ſpirituall Principles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly: In the people of God, there is much <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>ſelfe-love, carnall ends, intereſts &amp;c.</hi> which (many times) ſway their <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> much, and thereby their <hi>Iudgments</hi> are <hi>darkened,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degrees of theſe corruptions: For as any ſoule growes in <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and gets more of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> or <hi>Image of God,</hi> ſo are the <hi>things of God more,</hi> or <hi>leſſe</hi> manifeſt to ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God will be ſeene, and acknowledged in the world, eſpecially in his <hi>great diſpenſations,</hi> therefore are his waies often ſo unſuted to the apprehenſions of men; but when they ſee at length, that God brings about his <hi>ends</hi> by them, which they thought ſo unlikely, then they admire. He will get himſelfe glory in all his workings; by doing <hi>his worke,</hi> his <hi>ſtrange worke,</hi> and

               <p>Hence we may ſee the <hi>certaine downefall of Antichriſt,</hi> and all his partakers all the Enemies of God; becauſe the <hi>waies of God are <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Believers</hi> have the <hi>Image of God</hi> renewed in them, and his <hi>Law</hi> written in their hearts, That is <hi>knowledg, diſpoſitions, and inclinations</hi> carrying them (by a ſpiritually naturall power) to what <hi>is holy, juſt, and good,</hi> in ſome degree as <hi>Adam</hi> had in his <hi>innocency:</hi> ſoe that they <hi>Naturally bring forth good fruits,</hi> and have <hi>a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

               </p>
               <p>Although <hi>every believer</hi> is ingrafted into Chriſt, and draws ſap and vertue from him, and hath the countenance of God towards him, and the influences of the ſpirit to cauſe fruit-fulneſſe, yet not all alike: there is great difference in the <hi>degrees</hi> of Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting, and giving out of himſelfe to his people. God is a <hi>ſun</hi> to his people, and he ſhines upon ſome but ſeldome, and clouds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe and withdrawes for a time, and then a winter comes upon that ſoule.

The workings of the ſpirit of God,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168464:81"/> are manifeſt, evident and cleare to the ſoule: the ſoule acts upon God, and God upon the ſoule, there are reciprocall acts upon each other daily, frequently. The ſpirit of God <hi>witneſſeth, and ſealeth to the ſoule the ſure and unchangeable love of God in Chriſt,</hi> and the ſoule ſets to its ſeale alſo, that God is true, gratious, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſaies to God (with a lively faith) thou art he whom my ſoule loveth, thou art my <hi>portion, my Treaſure, my God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, my all through Chriſt.</hi> God acts upon the ſoule, and ſaies, <hi>thou art mine, I have choſen thee, and will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> and the ſoule acts upon God againe, and ſaies, <hi>thou art mine, thou haſt made me to chuſe thee, and I will love thee, and ſerve thee, and praiſe thee, and joy in thee for ever.</hi> Thus with <hi>infinite Acts of this Nature</hi> is this <hi>Communion</hi> continued (in daily walking with God) whereby ſuch ſoules are ſo revived, filled and ſatisfied, that they are <hi>abundantly fruitfull,</hi> and bring forth <hi>fruits continually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe trees are <hi>continually green and flouriſhing</hi> with <hi>leaves, bloſſoms and fruits:</hi> ſuch a one (as the Prophet ſaies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.8.) <hi>He ſhall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that ſpreadeth out her Rootes by the River, and ſhall not ſee when heat cometh, but her leafe ſhall be greene, and ſhall not be carefull in the year of drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yeilding fruit.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>He is as a tree plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the rivers of waters, his Leafe ſhall not wither, &amp;c.

               </p>

               <p>And as this is the love of Chriſt towards particular perſons, ſo alſo towards his <hi>whole Church:</hi> though the <hi>Church</hi> be as full of ſpots as the <hi>Moone,</hi> yet the exceeding love of Chriſt <hi>covers a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of faults, Prov.</hi> 10.12. and ſaies, <hi>thou art all faire my love, there is no ſpot in thee, Can.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Love beareth all things, endureth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.</p>
               <p>God doth not only conceale the failings of his people very much, but he takes notice of, and commends the moſt ſecret good they doe: and ſometimes publiſheth the ſecret and cloſet good works of his people <hi>upon the houſe top, Luk.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame, Rom.</hi> 13 3.

               <p>God is the great Husbandman of his Vineyard the Church, and having many fruit-trees in it, he prunes, orders, and gives them convenient culture from yeare to yeare, by his <hi>word, ſpirit, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Providences, favours, frownes, Chaſtiſements,</hi> and all meanes, and lookes every one ſhould be fruit-full under all his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168464:94"/> And yet ſo it is, that many are unfruitfull, or beare but few, and ſmall fruits; though God expect much, they returne but little, now, notwithſtanding God of his infinite patience tarries and waites upon them for their fruits. Many yeares did the Lord waite for the <hi>fruits of Repentance</hi> from the old world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. <hi>The long ſuffering of God waited in the daies of Noah,</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> 30 18. <hi>The Lord will wait that he may be gratious.</hi> He <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>waters,</hi> and <hi>prunes,</hi> and <hi>dreſſes</hi> his <hi>fruit-trees,</hi> and then <hi>waits</hi> for their <hi>fruits in their ſeaſons, Luke</hi> 13.7. <hi>Theſe three yeares I come ſeeking fruit on this fig-tree.</hi> God cuts not downe <hi>fruit-trees</hi> ſuddenly for their unfruitfulneſſe, but ſends his <hi>word, and ſpirit,</hi> and cauſeth the <hi>dewes, and raine of Heaven</hi> to fall upon them in manifold <hi>mercies, and Providences,</hi> and then waits for, and expects fruits.

               </p>
               <p>This ſhould make us obſerve, and admire the abundant kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <label type="milestone">

               <p>The Idolatrous people mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. were very <hi>zealous,</hi> and earneſt in worſhiping their falſe gods, inſomuch that when the <hi>Prophet</hi> from God told them the danger thereof, and that it would be no leſſe than deſtruction to them if they continued ſo to provoke God, their ſpirits roſe againſt him, they anſwered him boldly, and ſtoutly, with one conſent, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.17. <hi>The word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not heare it of thee, but wee will doe whatſoever commeth out of our owne mouth, as to burne incenſe to the Queene of heaven, and to powre out drinke offerings unto her, as wee have done, both wee and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, our Kings and our Princes.</hi>

                  <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpell</hi> are imployed by God about his <hi>husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry;</hi> which is his Church and people, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. <hi>ye are Gods husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry:</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaies <hi>we are laborers together with God</hi> in this worke.</p>
               <p>Now carefull husbandmen are ſtill looking into the <hi>ſtate of their worke,</hi> how it is in this, and that, and the other particular, that ſo they may diligently apply themſelves; ſo doe <hi>faithfull Miniſters</hi> towards their people.</p>
               <p>They are alſo <hi>Shepheards,</hi> and it is the duty of <hi>Shepheards</hi> to watch over their <hi>flocks,</hi> and to conſider, and diligently to

               </p>
               <p>To <hi>take heed to the flock</hi> and to <hi>Overſee it,</hi> implyes <hi>a ſpeciall care</hi> to looke into, and to examine, and conſider the ſtate, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particulars, as well as to have an eye over them in the generall: So the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame word thrice in one Chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. <hi>them that have the Overſight of you:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>them that have the Overſight of you:</hi> and againe <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>them that have the Overſight of you;</hi> Though another tranſlation hath it, <hi>them that have the rule over you:</hi> but his ſeemes to carry in it that <hi>Lordly power and dominion</hi> which Chriſt will not allow any of his Miniſters over his people; he hath not ſet them as <hi>Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>But Overſeers, and Examples to the flocke;</hi> which is alſo agreeable to the words of the holy Ghoſt in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>the holy ghoſt hath made them Overſeers:</hi> which carries in it more of <hi>care,</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> than of <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>rule;</hi> according to that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is alſo further confirmed by the ſame word which the <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> uſeth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Feede the flocke of God which is among you, taking the Overſight thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now certainely <hi>this word</hi> ſo often uſed carries more in it, than <hi>only to Preach the Goſpell;</hi> And this is alſo more confirmed by the Example of the <hi>Apoſtle Paul,</hi> fully ſet forth in many places, who did not only <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>write</hi> to the Churches, but alſo did often enquire, and ſend to <hi>know their ſtate,</hi> yea, he went himſelfe to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches,</hi> and <hi>families,</hi> and <hi>Perſons,</hi> to whom he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>conſider,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> how it was with them, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I could no longer forbeare, I ſent to know your faith, &amp;c.</hi> And when he heard they ſtood faſt in the faith, it was matter of great conſolation to him, and of many thankſgivings unto God on their behalfe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and <hi>Col.</hi> 4.8. <hi>he ſent Tychicus to know their ſtate.</hi>

               <p>So alſo he <hi>ſent Timothy</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.19. <hi>That I alſo may be of good comfort when I know your ſtate.</hi> He calls upon <hi>Barnabas</hi> to goe with him to viſit poore ſoules, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.36. <hi>Let us go againe, and viſit our brethren in every Citty where we have preached the word of the Lord, and ſee how they doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea <hi>Paul</hi> earneſtly prayed for opportunities to performe this duty, he longed to <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>conferre</hi> with the Saints to whom he had preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.23, 24 <hi>without ceaſing I make mention alwaies in my Prayers, making requeſt to come unto you, for I long to ſee you, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>That ſo they may be inſtructed more perfectly in the deepe Myſteries of the kingdome of God; they may hereby come to be acquainted with the various methods, waies, and workings of the ſpirit of God in the hearts of his people, &amp; the wiles, &amp; depthes of Sathan; with the nature of grace, and; corruption. <hi>Miniſters ſhould ſtudy men, as they ſtudy books</hi> although they may come to know the generall Nature of theſe things from the <hi>Scriptures, Books,</hi> &amp; their <hi>owne particular experiences,</hi> yet unleſſe they take in <hi>this alſo, to converſe frequently with others, and looke into their ſtates</hi> they can never be ſo able to deale with ſoules as they ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Many content themſelves with ſome few particular <hi>Caſes,</hi> and <hi>Inſtances</hi> mentioned in ſcripture concerning <hi>Job, David, Human</hi> and ſome others, and ſcarce looke further, meaſuring all others moſt commonly by theſe, as not being (indeed) acquainted with the <hi>various,</hi> and <hi>different dealings</hi> of God with his people.</p>
               <p>Secondly: By <hi>looking into the particular ſtate</hi> of their people, they may ſpeake more ſutably, and ſeaſonably to them; when they know their <hi>particular Luſts,</hi> and <hi>corruptions, their Temptations, Caſes, doubts, &amp;c.</hi> their <hi>degrees of knowledg,</hi> and other <hi>graces,</hi> they may then apply the word more <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>effectually,</hi> than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they can upon all occaſions: As <hi>Phyſitians</hi> when they have enquired into, and know the ſtate of their <hi>Patients,</hi> may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Phyſicke</hi> more effectually than otherwiſe they can.

               </p>
               <p>In every generation God is carrying on <hi>ſome particular and ſpeciall deſigne</hi> or other; and ſome of his people <hi>help on</hi> the worke more than others, ſome rather <hi>hinder it:</hi> they <hi>preach, and pray, and act againſt it</hi> (through ignorance of it, being darkned with ſome <hi>luſts or worldly intereſts</hi>) Now, though God cannot forſake any of his people, though they oppoſe him, yet they ſhall looſe by it, they ſhall have leſſe of God than others, whoſe <hi>Judgments and waies concurre with God in his deſignes.</hi>

               <p>What <hi>ſpeciall care, and love</hi> did God manifeſt towards <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was eminently inſtrumentall for God (in his generation) in gods <hi>deſigne of bringing Iſrael out of Egipt, and carrying them to Canaan; Moſes</hi> had <hi>peculiar honour</hi> above others of Gods people, yea, above other <hi>Prophets</hi> in his time, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>If there be a Prophet among you,</hi> I <hi>the Lord will make my ſelfe knowne unto him in a viſion, and will ſpeake unto him in a dreame.

               <p>But to touch breifly what we have grounds to believe is Gods <hi>great deſigne</hi> which he is now carrying on (more eſpecially in this generation) it is; <hi>the enlargment of the Kingdome of his ſonne Jeſus Chriſt; the ſetting up Chriſt as King over the Nations more gloriouſly than ever heretofore:</hi> according to many <hi>promiſes, Eſay.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day, and Chap.</hi> 24.23. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. <hi>The Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Formerly the <hi>Jewes</hi> only were the people of God, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſtrangers to God, and without God in the world, wholly overſpread with <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> as we ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.

               </p>
               <p>God the great husbandman of his <hi>Orchard the Church,</hi> began to plant the vaſt, waſt grounds, the <hi>wilderneſſe of the Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Gentiles,</hi> above <hi>ſixteene hundred yeares</hi> agoe, and is ſtill about it, and will at length finiſh it, and performe all his purpoſe, and pleaſures towards them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>time when he began</hi> this <hi>great plantation</hi> was <hi>in our Saviours daies,</hi> who gave light to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that ſate in darkneſſe; but eſpecially after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> he ſet his husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (the <hi>Apoſtles and Diſciples</hi>) on worke, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe teach all Nations, and Mark.</hi> 13.10. <hi>the Goſpell muſt be publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>They ſaw this wonderfull <hi>great plantation</hi> begun, and cut out of the <hi>waſt, and barren Wilderneſſe of the Gentiles,</hi> and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in it, and helped to carry it on: <hi>Paul planted a large peece of ground,</hi> and God <hi>watered it,</hi> and gave the <hi>increaſe:</hi> for he tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19. <hi>from Jeruſalem round about unto Illyricum he fully preached the Goſpell of Chriſt:</hi> he <hi>(through the power of the word and ſpirit)</hi> made <hi>wild trees, barren, unfruit-full trees,</hi> to be <hi>engrafted, fruitfull trees:</hi> The <hi>Goſpell</hi> (containing the unſearchable riches of Chriſt) which he preached among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> became in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted word</hi> in their hearts, and ſprang and grew up, and brought forth fruit as he tels us <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Goſpell which is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruits, as it doth alſo in you ſince the day ye heard of it.</hi>
